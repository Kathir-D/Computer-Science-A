Lab Goal : The lab was designed to teach you how to use &&, ||, and !.
Lab Description : Generate a random choice for the computer player. Next, the person player will
make a choice. Finally, you take the two choices and see which one of the players is the winner. You will
need to use Math.random().
Sample Data :
random â€“ see below
Sample Output :
Rock-Paper-Scissors - pick your weapon[R,P,S]:: R
player had R
computer had P
!Computer wins <<Paper Covers Rock>>!
Do you want to play again? y
